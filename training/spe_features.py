"""Sub-block Peak Energy (SPE) transient features for the note discriminator.

Inspired by Fan et al. "Transient Detection Methods for Audio Coding,"
AES 155th Convention 2023. Adapted here for bass/guitar stem onset scoring:
instead of codec block-switching, we use SPE ratios as scalar features
that tell the discriminator whether a real pluck transient exists near
each basic-pitch detection.

Core idea: high-pass filter the stem, then compare peak amplitude of each
sub-block to the immediately preceding one. A large ratio = real transient.
This is completely timbre-agnostic — it doesn't matter what the bass sounds
like, only whether there is a rapid amplitude rise at the note onset.
